## Logistics Orders Business Analysis Project - Visualizations/Data Analysis Power B.I.

Used Power B.I., Power Query/Pivot, and Excel to organize, automate, and create responsive visualizations that are updated as new data comes in. This project was from my Advanced Excel Data Analytics class, and the logistic project is based on common situations that data and business analysts encounter when analyzing data, and effective ways to solve these problems through creating responsive datasets that update from databases, responsive data paths and configurations, and responsive visualizations.
